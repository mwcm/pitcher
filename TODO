TODO:
- test scipy vs librosa resample, use one consistently or expose as option
- progress bar or some sort of loading indicator
- smaller exe size
- dedicated 33rpm -> 45rpm pre-processing stretch option
- could add moog_output_filter_cutoff slider and/or lp2 cutoff slider to gui
- Android apk
- only use ffmpeg/libav when necessary
- perfect high end input anti aliasing filter fit (close enough, not a priority for now)
